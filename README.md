# Identify-Data-Leakage-in-Machine-Learning-Models

In this project, we will investigate the factors influencing student outcomes—Dropout, Enrolled, or Graduate—using machine learning techniques, including decision tree and random forest classifiers. A central focus of this project is understanding and addressing data leakage, a critical issue in machine learning where features inadvertently provide information about the target variable that would not be available at prediction time. Data leakage often leads to inflated performance metrics, misleading model interpretations, and poor generalization to unseen data.

By carefully analyzing feature selection and model outputs, we will demonstrate how to identify and mitigate data leakage. Through this process, learners will build robust, interpretable models that deliver fair and realistic predictions. The project highlights the importance of ensuring that only valid predictors are used, maintaining the integrity of the modeling pipeline.

# Objectives
**After completing this lab, you will:**

Understand how to preprocess real-world datasets by identifying critical features prone to leakage and mapping data to ensure ethical and practical use.
Build and evaluate machine learning models such as decision trees and random forests, with a focus on preventing data leakage and interpreting results using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and confusion matrices.
Learn how to recognize the signs of data leakage and implement techniques to mitigate its impact, ensuring model validity.


# Setup
For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

pandas for managing the data.
numpy for mathematical operations.
sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
seaborn for visualizing the data.
matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
